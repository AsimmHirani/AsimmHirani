- 👋 Hi, I’m @AsimmHirani
- 👀 I'm interested in boostrapping open-source embedded solutions for healthcare, transportation, and logistics
- 🌱 I’m currently learning PCB layout, Rust, and network programming
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that open up technologies that have traditionally been closed off
- 📫 How to reach me - My LinkedIn is @AsimmHirani

I am a mechanical engineer by trade who is interested in helping build a more open future!
Hardware is a passion of mine and I think there is a sincere dearth of open-source reference designs for people to build off of.
Reach out to me if you have a project that you want to collaborate on or any questions about my work.
